Test Plan


1. 
    We each created test cases and put them in separate mark down tables and
    then created separate PR's. Once all the markdown tables were merged
    onto github they were combined into one.

2.  
    Your understanding of how the chosen testing framework works to test the frontend, 
    including your understandings of when and how the test cases will be running directly on GitHub.

    We'll be using Selenium to automate the front-end testing. When the
    Selenium script runs the front-end will be sending requests to a mock
    API that returns test data.

    These tests will run when there is a PR on Github to make sure the PR
    doesn't break anything.

3.
    We'll create a folder for all the test case files and subfolders for all
    the routes.
